This intensely human story deals with the personal impact of the Australian Government's Pacific Solution. The story emerges through personal interviews with key players directly involved with the issue, united by a common concern for the refugees. And it is the inspiring story of Chaman Shah Nasiri, a Hazara refugee from Afghanistan, who represented the detainees. When claims for asylum were rejected following prolonged and indefinite incarceration, a group of detainees began a hunger strike in a final act of desperation. Their official statement and slogan was freedom or death. This documentary explores a deeply controversial chapter in our history exposing human rights abuses, which were deliberately hidden from the international community. It brings light to key issues including children in detention, the forced separation of families, Nauru's environmental degradation, and the hunger strikes. Featuring interviews with Frederika Steen, Hassan Ghulam, Chaman Shah Nasiri, Julian Burnside QC, Andrew Bartlett, Keith Davis and Dr Sima Samar.  aIn English. 0aDetention of personszAustralia. 0aAliensxInstitutional carezAustralia. 0aAlien detention centerszNauru. 0aNoncitizenszAustralia. 0aRefugeesxGovernment policyzAustralia. 0aPolitical refugeeszAustralia. 0aAustraliaxEmigration and immigrationxGovernment policy. 0aNauruxPolitics and government. 7aDocumentary films.2lcgft1 aSpencer, Elliot,eproducer,edirector.40zAvailable to Stanford-affiliated users.uhttp://www.aspresolver.com/aspresolver.asp?MARC;3295242yProquest Border and Migration Studies OnlinexProvider: Alexander StreetxpurchasedxeLoaderURLxbg4xbg99182650000971  aeLoaderRecord xbg4ffi51a7b1f1-29f7-4c1c-a4a3-609197c4a682s37e14e8c-2af6-4add-ac9c-a66c1a194da
